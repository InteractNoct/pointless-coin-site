            <h3>Why Invest in $Pointless? </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Because you’ve already wasted 5 minutes here!</li>
                <li>It’s the only coin that promises nothing and delivers! </li>
                <li>Because you're bored.</li>
                <li>Because memes are life.</li>
                <li>Because your dog accidentally stepped on your keyboard and now you're a degen.</li>
                <li>Tokenomics?
                    Yes. We have them.
                    We just won't tell you what they are.
                    Trust us — or don’t. It’s pointless either way.</li>
                <li>Use Case:

                    Excellent for absolutely nothing.
                    
                    Can’t buy coffee with it.
                    
                    Won’t save the environment.
                    
                    Still better than your ex.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Market cap: it’s pointless. Ground floor of nothingness! </p>

            <h3>The Totally Pointless Tale of $Pointless Coin! GibberGarbage!</h3>
            <div class="story-container" id="story-container">
                <div class="gif-column left-gifs"></div>
                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>Welcome, weary traveler of the digital void, to the grand, nonsensical saga of $Pointless Coin, a cryptocurrency so devoid of purpose that it once convinced a flock of confused pigeons to invest their breadcrumbs in it during a particularly foggy Tuesday afternoon in 2023. Picture this: a rubber duck named Sir Quackington III, who had accidentally floated into a cosmic laundromat after a particularly vigorous spin cycle on the Milky Way’s spin-drier setting, stumbled upon a glowing vending machine that dispensed nothing but air and the occasional kazoo. This, dear reader, was the birthplace of $Pointless Coin—or so the legend goes, though legends are about as reliable as a chocolate teapot in a heatwave. BlurbBlop!</p>
                    <p>Sir Quackington, with his slightly soggy crown askew, decided that the best way to spend his newfound air fortune was to hire a troupe of tap-dancing anteaters to perform a musical number about the futility of existence, which they did with such enthusiasm that the vibrations caused a nearby asteroid to sprout a mustache made entirely of lint. This mustache, it turns out, became the unofficial mascot of $Pointless Coin, winking at passersby in the asteroid belt and occasionally shedding glitter that floated down to Earth, where it was mistaken for fairy dust by a group of particularly gullible garden gnomes. These gnomes, in turn, started a cult dedicated to the worship of lint-mustaches, and their weekly meetings involved reciting haikus about the smell of wet socks while sipping imaginary tea from cups made of moonbeams. FizzleFoop!</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, back in the cosmic laundromat, Sir Quackington discovered that the vending machine had a secret compartment filled with expired jellybeans that tasted suspiciously like regret. He traded these jellybeans to a passing comet named Carl, who was on a quest to find the world’s largest sock puppet but got distracted by the promise of a jellybean-flavored disco party. Carl, in his infinite comet wisdom, decided to invest half his tail in $Pointless Coin, which promptly vanished into a black hole of bureaucratic paperwork that no one ever bothered to file because, well, why would they? The black hole, feeling slightly miffed at being used as a filing cabinet, spat out a single $Pointless Coin token that landed on a deserted island where a crab named Percival had been practicing interpretive dance for an audience of seagulls who didn’t care. DripDrop!</p>
                    <p>Percival, inspired by the coin’s shiny uselessness, decided to build a throne out of sandcastles and declared himself the King of Pointlessness, ruling over a kingdom where the currency was compliments about the weather and the national anthem was a series of random honks performed by a malfunctioning car horn he found washed ashore. One day, a tourist—a particularly bored accountant named Gerald who had misplaced his calculator in a hedge—stumbled onto the island, saw the $Pointless Coin, and decided it was the perfect investment because it reminded him of the time he spent three hours alphabetizing his sock drawer only to realize he owned 47 left socks and no rights. Gerald, in a fit of existential glee, used his last SOL to buy 420 $Pointless Coins, which he then mailed to his aunt Mildred, who used them as coasters for her collection of lukewarm tea. SquishSquelch!</p>
                    <p>Back in the cosmos, the tap-dancing anteaters had evolved into a synchronized swimming team, performing underwater ballets in a puddle on Mars that was rumored to be the tears of a forgotten astronaut who lost his sandwich to a rogue tumbleweed. Their performances were broadcasted via a glitchy hologram that flickered across the Solana blockchain, accidentally minting $Pointless Coin tokens with faces of confused anteaters instead of the intended lint-mustache. These tokens became collector’s items among a group of space otters who traded them for shiny bottle caps, which they used to decorate their underwater disco ball—because why not? PuddlePloop!</p>
                    <p>The story took an even more pointless turn when a time-traveling toaster named Toasty McToastface popped into the narrative, claiming it had invented $Pointless Coin during a bread-baking experiment gone wrong in the year 3047. Toasty insisted that the coin’s true purpose was to power a fleet of self-destructing paper airplanes, which it demonstrated by launching one that promptly crashed into a cloud of cotton candy floating near Jupiter, causing a sticky mess that attracted a swarm of glitter-obsessed butterflies. These butterflies, in a moment of collective madness, decided to invest their wing-dust savings into $Pointless Coin, driving its market cap to “it’s pointless” status, a value so abstract it could only be measured in sighs and shrugged shoulders. BlobBlah!</p>
                    <p>And so, $Pointless Coin chugged along, a cryptocurrency with no roadmap, no utility, and no ambition beyond existing as a monument to human (and duck) absurdity. It’s traded on Photon by insomniac night owls who argue about whether the lint-mustache mascot should have a unibrow, and its community of ~400 HODLers meets annually in a virtual swamp to exchange stories about the time they tried to use $Pointless Coin to buy a cloud but ended up with a slightly damp napkin instead. This is the legacy of $Pointless Coin—a tale so pointless it loops back into being hilariously entertaining, inviting you to join the Pointless Posse and invest in nothing for the sheer joy of wasting your SOL. Welcome aboard, and may your wallet be as empty as your expectations! GunkGloop!</p>
